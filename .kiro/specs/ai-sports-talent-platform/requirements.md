# Requirements Document

## Introduction

The AI-Powered Sports Talent Assessment Platform is a comprehensive system that enables athletes to perform standardized sports assessments using their mobile devices, with real-time AI analysis and professional-grade verification. The platform combines on-device AI processing for immediate feedback with server-side verification for accurate talent evaluation, providing coaches and scouts with reliable data through an administrative dashboard.

## Requirements

### Requirement 1

**User Story:** As an athlete, I want to perform sports assessments using my mobile device with real-time AI guidance, so that I can receive immediate feedback on my performance and have my results verified professionally.

#### Acceptance Criteria

1. WHEN an athlete opens the mobile app THEN the system SHALL display available assessment tests with clear guidelines
2. WHEN an athlete selects a test THEN the system SHALL show test instructions and countdown timer
3. WHEN the countdown completes THEN the system SHALL begin live video capture (not pre-recorded)
4. WHEN video capture is active THEN the on-device AI SHALL perform real-time analysis using YOLOv8, MediaPipe, and OpenCV
5. WHEN the test is completed THEN the system SHALL generate preliminary scores and provide instant feedback
6. IF the device is offline THEN the system SHALL store results locally for later synchronization
7. WHEN connectivity is restored THEN the system SHALL automatically upload stored results to the backend

### Requirement 2

**User Story:** As a system administrator, I want the backend to verify and process all assessment results with advanced AI models, so that I can ensure data integrity and provide accurate talent evaluations.

#### Acceptance Criteria

1. WHEN assessment data is received THEN the API Gateway SHALL route requests through Nginx to Django backend
2. WHEN processing begins THEN the system SHALL queue verification tasks using Celery and Redis
3. WHEN server-side verification runs THEN the system SHALL re-analyze using YOLO and OpenCV models
4. WHEN cheat detection is performed THEN the system SHALL flag suspicious activities and integrity violations
5. WHEN verification is complete THEN the system SHALL calculate final scores and update MongoDB
6. WHEN scores are finalized THEN the system SHALL update leaderboards and athlete profiles
7. WHEN processing is complete THEN the system SHALL store video proof clips in object storage

### Requirement 3

**User Story:** As a coach or scout, I want to access verified assessment results through a professional dashboard, so that I can evaluate talent and make informed decisions.

#### Acceptance Criteria

1. WHEN accessing the admin dashboard THEN the system SHALL display verified scores and analytics charts
2. WHEN viewing athlete profiles THEN the system SHALL show assessment history and performance trends
3. WHEN searching for talent THEN the system SHALL provide filters by sport, performance metrics, and location
4. WHEN viewing assessment details THEN the system SHALL display video proof clips and AI analysis data
5. WHEN generating reports THEN the system SHALL create talent heatmaps and comparative analytics
6. WHEN exporting data THEN the system SHALL provide downloadable reports in standard formats

### Requirement 4

**User Story:** As an athlete, I want to receive notifications about my assessment results, so that I can stay informed about my verification status and scores.

#### Acceptance Criteria

1. WHEN assessment verification is complete THEN the system SHALL send push notification via Firebase Cloud Messaging
2. WHEN scores are updated THEN the system SHALL notify the athlete of changes to their profile
3. WHEN leaderboard position changes THEN the system SHALL send relevant notifications
4. IF notification delivery fails THEN the system SHALL retry with exponential backoff
5. WHEN the athlete opens the app THEN the system SHALL display in-app notifications for unread updates

### Requirement 5

**User Story:** As a system architect, I want the platform to handle high-performance AI processing and scalable data storage, so that the system can support thousands of concurrent assessments reliably.

#### Acceptance Criteria

1. WHEN mobile devices perform AI analysis THEN the system SHALL use TensorFlow Lite for efficient on-device processing
2. WHEN storing athlete data THEN the system SHALL use MongoDB for profiles, results, and metadata
3. WHEN storing media files THEN the system SHALL use object storage (S3/MinIO) for videos and proof clips
4. WHEN processing background tasks THEN the system SHALL use Redis for caching and task queuing
5. WHEN handling API requests THEN the system SHALL maintain response times under 200ms for standard operations
6. WHEN scaling the system THEN the architecture SHALL support horizontal scaling of all components
7. WHEN ensuring data integrity THEN the system SHALL implement proper backup and recovery mechanisms
